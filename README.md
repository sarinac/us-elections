 🇺🇸📝🗳

[See write-up here](https://ifcolorful.com/us-elections/)!

I migrated my code from [this repository](https://github.com/sarinac/Visual-Sandbox/tree/master/06_us_election) in order to enable GitHub Pages by project.

I joined in on the 2020 U.S. Election Data Visualization bandwagon. My data source is from the [MIT Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data), which provided presidential election data from 1976 to 2016, and [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-Electoral-College-Votes-by-State-1787124), which provided the latest table of U.S. electoral votes by state.
